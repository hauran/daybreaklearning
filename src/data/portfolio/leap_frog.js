  description:"LeapFrog's interactive books have revolutionized early reading and literacy. Each book's content is brought to life with dialogue, songs, games and personalized learning tracks. I designed the content and gameplay while managing the production of nine notable books, many of which received educational awards and were bestsellers in their category.",
  challenge:"My over-arching challenge, through all book titles, was to use technology in a way that enhanced children's imaginations rather than restricted them to a scripted experience.",
  strategy:"I went beyond the user sessions required by LeapFrog and met with young users as much as schedule and budget would allow. In testing, I never told kids what to do, but rather learned from all the unexpected ways they would interact with the prototypes. As a result, my books were known for their engaging content and intuitive play patterns. Awards include the Parents' Choice Award, KTVU's Best of the Rest Education Toy Award and the National Parenting Center's Seal of Approval.",
