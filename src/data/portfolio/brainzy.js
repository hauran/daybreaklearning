  description: "When Education.com,  the leading source of online worksheets, embarked on game development, they stepped into a foreign terrain without a clear path. I helped them find their way by identifying market needs, defining a unique product vision and outlining a clear curricular game path.",
  challenge: "The competitive market for online educational content is already formidable and increasing dramatically. How can I help the company use their limited resources and time to develop a truly distinct product?",
  strategy: "When I began the project, the internal production team already had amassed considerable content and curricular material. But the emerging material lacked a clear framework and the product vision was hazy and vague.  Before launching into design, I helped the team articulate a compelling strategy and product voice that set them apart in the crowded market.  I presented this strategy with detailed product requirements that were hammered out with the team and became the foundation of the product's design.",
