	description:"This online reading platform needed to be repositioned for its main users. I spearheaded research with its target audience to deliver design and functionality recommendations.",
	challenge:"Pearson Foundation wasn't sure about how to invest in the site to prepare for the upcoming Read for the Record event that would bring peak traffic to the site. I realized that while WeGiveBooks.org had an amazing product to share– children's books for reading and exploring for free online – the site design and features were being driven by marketing rather than user needs. How can I show stakeholders that listening and responding to users is the best way to increase the site's popularity, traffic and long term success?",
	strategy:"I spearheaded a qualitative user study to understand the target users motivations, use patterns and current limitations. I showed stakeholders how simple improvements such as a better search function and a more intuitive reading interface would increase user engagement and retention. By timing these improvements with the high-traffic event, we attracted new users and developed a loyal base.",
