  description:"Millions of students participated in the National Student Mock Election, the country's largest civic engagement project. I produced its new interactive site, with innovative resources for students and educators.",
  challenge:"How do I translate enthusiasm and participation in the Mock Election into continued civic engagement throughout the year? Once students vote and see the election results, how do I keep them coming back to the site to learn and voice their opinion about important issues?",
  strategy:"I created a Pinterest-like space where classrooms share their photos and stories about their Mock Election, thus channeling enthusiasm from the election past into the current conversation. I also developed content for a student projects page that keeps students engaged in political thought after the election. Activities such as \"Find Jeremy a Job\" and \"No Issue Stands Alone\" inspire students to think deeply about nuanced topics and brainstorm their own solutions.",
