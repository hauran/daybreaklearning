  description:"Toddlers learn about their bodies and movement in this award-winning interactive Backyardigans adventure. I scripted and produced over 45 minutes of original animation intermixed with photography and video footage.",
  challenge:"Toddlers were expected to interact with the DVD by pushing buttons on LeapFrog's new Little Leaps console, but users this young can't be expected to follow verbal cues. I wanted to deliver instructions that were clear and intuitive, but didn't break out of the fantasy world of The Backyardigans.",
  strategy:"The look of the console reminded me of the dashboard of an airplane. So I embarked upon an airplane theme for the story plot, enabling an onscreen representation identical to the console in front of the child. Our animators created a reusable sequence from the viewpoint of the pilots asking \"you,\" the user, to help the plane land or takeoff by moving the joystick or pushing a button. User testing showed that these visual cues motivated toddlers to interact with the console and become active participants in the adventure.",
