	description:"This English/Spanish learning radio teaches toddlers over 50 first words through interactive prompts, riddles, songs and music. I designed and managed the production of this best-selling toy, which has been translated into three languages for a global audience.",
	challenge:"There was an immediate need to boost the LeapFrog 2009 toy line despite a dwindling budget and timeline. I was asked to revamp an existing product with bilingual content to teach first words to toddlers. To succeed, we needed a product that felt like a truly new experience rather than a rehash of old material.",
	strategy:"I spoke with education experts on how to foster bilingual word development and reviewed the current consumer products teaching first words. I learned that words are best taught in their environmental context and reinforced through multisensory exploration. Since no product on the market was doing this, I designed the radio with environmental pages, catchy songs, clickable buttons and engaging lights that captured toddlers' eyes, ears and hands. The best part? This redesign was really a re-skin of a previously made LeapFrog toy, keeping costs low.",
