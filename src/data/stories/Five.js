    "Tomorrow I'll be five, or so I'm told.
    So today, I` just want to enjoy being five.
    Only, no one will let me!

    \"Where's my five year old big boy?\" asks Aunt Lina, who's come for supper.
    \"If you mean me, I'm five,\" I correct her.
    She usually lifts me up and spins me round like I'm flying.
    But today she just messes my hair and walks by.
    I guess five year olds are too old for airplane.

    \"Good evening, Sir Maxi,\" says Daddy, picking me up from the kitchen chair.
    I put my hands around his neck. I'm glad he still remembers I'm just a kid.
    \"Whoa! I forgot how big you are now!\" and he plops me down on the table.  
    \"Maybe you can start carrying me!\"

    \"Max is looking bigger,\" says Mama, squinting her eyes at me. \"I think it's time for
    the big boy chair at the table.\" Aunt Lina and Daddy make fake ooooh and ahhh
    noises, too loud to be real.

    Suddenly, it's all just too much for me.

    \"STOP IT!  STOP IT OK!  I'M STILL FOUR!\"

    I run out the door, out of the house and on the porch.
    My last day of four is ruined!
    I might as well sit here and wait for the sun to go down.  
    I hide deep inside my hoodie, but I still feel Mama coming near.

    \"What's wrong Maxi?\"
    So I tell her.
    \"I just wanted to be five today. I know it all changes tomorrow. Everyone's counting
    on me to be so grown up.\"

    \"Hold on, I'll be right back.\" Mama says, and runs back in the house. She returns
    with our coats. \"Let's go for a walk.\"

    I like walking with Mama. She doesn't mind if I stop to look at interesting things,
    like a drawing on the sidewalk. Sometimes, she'll show me something I missed
    seeing, like a bird's nest above a doorway.

    We walked and walked until the Slanted Park. We climbed our way to the top &
    Mama held her hand out, pointing below.
    'See that hill? You know what I see on it?\"

    I shook my head.
    \"I see me, eleven year old me, rolling down the hill like a baking pin. Look and
    see!\"
    Could it be? That dirt smudged girl, rolling and laughing, my Mama? Where could
    her pocketbook be?

    \"C'mon, let's get ice cream!\" Mama pulls me down the park.
    \"But we'll spoil our supper!\" I remind her, but there's no stopping my Mama.
    At the Ice Cream shop, I order a simple strawberry scoop, like a grown up would.
    Then Mama orders.
    \"Let's see, I'll have a scoop of orange creamsicle, one chocolate cookie dough,
    and one rocky road. I'd like that in a banana split with some caramel, and lots of
    gummy bears, especially the red ones.\"
    Mama whispered to me, \"I've been getting this now and again, since I was about
    four.\"

    So that explains why the red gummy bears are also missing from the candy jar. We
    take our ice cream and walk back to the park, I watch the sun set behind Mama,
    and she slurps her ice cream.

    Mama wants to sit in the park, but walks past our usual sitting spot.
    \"Let's sit over by the street lights. I get scared of the dark sometimes.
    \"I do too, sometimes,\" I whisper back, even though I'm turning five and I know
    better than to be scared.

    We sit and watch the world go by and Mama doesn't stop to check her phone.
    \"In the evenings, when I'm at this park, I forget how old I am. I feel like I'm as old or
    as young as I want to be right now.\"

    \"Right now, I want to four, \" I say.
    \"So let's be four!\" Mama laughs.
    \"And tomorrow, Mama?\"
    Mama lay back on the grass.

    \"Tomorrow? I guess we'll just leave that till tomorrow.\"
    I agree, that's enough about tomorrow. Today, I'm with my Mama, protecting her
    from the dark."
