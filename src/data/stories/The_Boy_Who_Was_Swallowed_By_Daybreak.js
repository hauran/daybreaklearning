    "The thick folds between the black of night and the glow of day tell the story of Muska.

    Muska was a boy who dreamt impossible dreams.  Other children dreamt of
    sweets in the morning, seesaws in the afternoon, and salamanders at night.

    But Muska dreamt of one thing all the time, to see the sun and the moon come
    together. Each day, he'd watch the solitary sun, shimmering in the silent sky. As
    the sun sank away, the moon swept in to sit in that same lonely sky.

    Before dinner, Muska would watch the sunset from his roof. \"Don't go away just
    yet,\" he'd plead with the departing sun, \"why not stay awhile and play with the
    moon?\"  But the sun said he must go, carrying his bag full of bright orange and
    pink as he left. At night, the stars tried to comfort their mother, glowing as fiercely
    as they could through the long nights. 
    But the Moon's face still brimmed with craters of tears. 

    Poor moon and poor sun, thought Muska, why must they be apart? He imagined
    a world without separation of night and day. A world where stars lay in hammocks
    of white clouds. A world with pillows in math class, snack time in dreams, energy
    wrapped in rest. 

    \"It can never be!\" said Maneta, Muska's older and wiser sister. She tried to
    distract her brother, but with no luck. He was always sad for his two friends, the
    melancholy moon and the simmering sun.

    One day, while playing at the foot of the forest, Muska smelt a strange scent.
    Mixed in with the aroma of bark and leaves was a trace of peppercorn and cloves.
    It reminded him of the family's Friday night stew. Only today was Tuesday and
    Muska was far from his kitchen. Where could the spicy smell be from? Muska
    followed the flavorful wafts to a small hole in an old gnarled tree. He stuck his eye
    in the hole and gasped when a face smiled back at him!

    It was the wrinkly face of an old man with a sorcerer's pointy hat and a braided
    beard down to his round belly. \"Would you like to join me for dinner?\" asked the
    sorcerer, pushing open the wall of the trunk and ushering Muska inside. 

    The boy was amazed to find a space at least twice the size of his small home. The
    walls were filled with spice bottles, strange plants, pots and pans.  \"I'm cooking my
    specialty,\" said the old man, \"I call it the Stew of Impossible Dreams.\" As he stirred
    in some moldy tomatoes, the sorcerer explained his dish. All the man wanted in
    life was to spend his days in this beautiful tree. \"They said it was impossible, but
    luckily, I had just the recipe for impossible dreams!\"

    Muska didn't trust this funny man. Wise Maneta had told him, there's no such thing
    as sorcerers or magic soup. But, he was hungry, so he agreed to stay for dinner.
    He leapt into a big chair and took a spoonful of stew. The first few slurps were
    tasty, the fiveth made Muska laugh out loud and the seventh made him burp a
    bubble. But it was the eighth slurp that did something spectacular. With the eighth
    swallow, Muska was lifted up through the tree hole and swept through the long wild
    branches. He was lifted higher still, carried by the wind of a dusk time sky. Muska

    drifted over clouds of bright orange and pink until he was finally dropped into the
    sky's innermost fold. Between the black of night and the glow of day.

    This is where you'll still find Muska, the boy who was swallowed by daybreak. If
    you listen close, you'll still hear him slurping his soup."
