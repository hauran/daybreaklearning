    description: "When Education.com,  the leading source of online worksheets, embarked on game development, they stepped into a foreign terrain without a clear path. I helped them find their way by identifying market needs, defining a unique product vision and outlining a clear curricular game path.",
    challenge: "The competitive market for online educational content is already formidable and increasing dramatically. How can I help the company use their limited resources and time to develop a truly distinct product?",
    strategy: "When I began the project, the internal production team already had amassed considerable content and curricular material. But the emerging material lacked a clear framework and the product vision was hazy and vague.  Before launching into design, I helped the team articulate a compelling strategy and product voice that set them apart in the crowded market.  I presented this strategy with detailed product requirements that were hammered out with the team and became the foundation of the product's design.",

    strategy:"I created a Pinterest-like space where classrooms share their photos and stories about their Mock Election, thus channeling enthusiasm from the election past into the current conversation. I also developed content for a student projects page that keeps students engaged in political thought after the election. Activities such as \"Find Jeremy a Job\" and \"No Issue Stands Alone\" inspire students to think deeply about nuanced topics and brainstorm their own solutions.",

    challenge:"Pearson Foundation wasn't sure about how to invest in the site to prepare for the upcoming Read for the Record event that would bring peak traffic to the site. I realized that while WeGiveBooks.org had an amazing product to share– children's books for reading and exploring for free online – the site design and features were being driven by marketing rather than user needs. How can I show stakeholders that listening and responding to users is the best way to increase the site's popularity, traffic and long term success?",
    strategy:"I spearheaded a qualitative user study to understand the target users motivations, use patterns and current limitations. I showed stakeholders how simple improvements such as a better search function and a more intuitive reading interface would increase user engagement and retention. By timing these improvements with the high-traffic event, we attracted new users and developed a loyal base.",

    challenge:"Toddlers were expected to interact with the DVD by pushing buttons on LeapFrog's new Little Leaps console, but users this young can't be expected to follow verbal cues. I wanted to deliver instructions that were clear and intuitive, but didn't break out of the fantasy world of The Backyardigans.",
    strategy:"The look of the console reminded me of the dashboard of an airplane. So I embarked upon an airplane theme for the story plot, enabling an onscreen representation identical to the console in front of the child. Our animators created a reusable sequence from the viewpoint of the pilots asking \"you,\" the user, to help the plane land or takeoff by moving the joystick or pushing a button. User testing showed that these visual cues motivated toddlers to interact with the console and become active participants in the adventure.",

    description:"LeapFrog's interactive books have revolutionized early reading and literacy. Each book's content is brought to life with dialogue, songs, games and personalized learning tracks. I designed the content and gameplay while managing the production of nine notable books, many of which received educational awards and were bestsellers in their category.",
    challenge:"My over-arching challenge, through all book titles, was to use technology in a way that enhanced children's imaginations rather than restricted them to a scripted experience.",
    strategy:"I went beyond the user sessions required by LeapFrog and met with young users as much as schedule and budget would allow. In testing, I never told kids what to do, but rather learned from all the unexpected ways they would interact with the prototypes. As a result, my books were known for their engaging content and intuitive play patterns. Awards include the Parents' Choice Award, KTVU's Best of the Rest Education Toy Award and the National Parenting Center's Seal of Approval.",

    description:"This English/Spanish learning radio teaches toddlers over 50 first words through interactive prompts, riddles, songs and music. I designed and managed the production of this best-selling toy, which has been translated into three languages for a global audience.",
    challenge:"There was an immediate need to boost the LeapFrog 2009 toy line despite a dwindling budget and timeline. I was asked to revamp an existing product with bilingual content to teach first words to toddlers. To succeed, we needed a product that felt like a truly new experience rather than a rehash of old material.",
    strategy:"I spoke with education experts on how to foster bilingual word development and reviewed the current consumer products teaching first words. I learned that words are best taught in their environmental context and reinforced through multisensory exploration. Since no product on the market was doing this, I designed the radio with environmental pages, catchy songs, clickable buttons and engaging lights that captured toddlers' eyes, ears and hands. The best part? This redesign was really a re-skin of a previously made LeapFrog toy, keeping costs low.",
