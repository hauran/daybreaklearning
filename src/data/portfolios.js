Often, learners are so parlysed to speak publicly that it’s hard to really engage with other people.

This always learners to practice in a highly-realistic simulated environment, so they can gain comfort in a safe space.

I learned that words are best taught in their environmental context and reinforced through multisensory exploration.

The best part? This redesign was really a re-skin of a previously made LeapFrog toy, keeping costs low.",
