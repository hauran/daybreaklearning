        "Developed a strategy for a unique gaming product for ELA instruction that aligned the company's core competencies.",

    description: "When Education.com,  the leading source of online worksheets, embarked on game development, they stepped into a foreign terrain without a clear path. I helped them find their way by identifying market needs, defining a unique product vision and outlining a clear curricular game path.",
    challenge: "The competitive market for online educational content is already formidable and increasing dramatically. How can I help the company use their limited resources and time to develop a truly distinct product?",
    strategy: "When I began the project, the internal production team already had amassed considerable content and curricular material. But the emerging material lacked a clear framework and the product vision was hazy and vague.  Before launching into design, I helped the team articulate a compelling strategy and product voice that set them apart in the crowded market.  I presented this strategy with detailed product requirements that were hammered out with the team and became the foundation of the product's design.",

    description:"Millions of students participated in the National Student Mock Election, the country's largest civic engagement project. I produced its new interactive site, with innovative resources for students and educators.",
    challenge:"How do I translate enthusiasm and participation in the Mock Election into continued civic engagement throughout the year? Once students vote and see the election results, how do I keep them coming back to the site to learn and voice their opinion about important issues?",
    strategy:"I created a Pinterest-like space where classrooms share their photos and stories about their Mock Election, thus channeling enthusiasm from the election past into the current conversation. I also developed content for a student projects page that keeps students engaged in political thought after the election. Activities such as \"Find Jeremy a Job\" and \"No Issue Stands Alone\" inspire students to think deeply about nuanced topics and brainstorm their own solutions.",
